    What is the <b> World Wide Web</b>?
<br> It is a collection of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) documents. Each webpage is a text document (that is written in HTML) and our browsers read these documents and display them back to us. 
<br><br>
What <b>components</b> are on a HTML doc?
<br>Text Content<br>
Markup 
<br>References<br>
Links to Other Pages 
<br><br>
What is <b>HTML Markup</b>?
<br>
It contains both an opening and closing tag along with the contents. Together these components are known as the element. There are various different tags that can be implemented to generate the output that we see on a webpage. Some of these include:
<br>The b Tag = Bold 
<br> The em Tag = Emphasis (Italics)
<br> <br> What are <b> HTML Attributes</b>?
<br> We can use an anchor tag and assign to it a reference such as a link to a website that is linked via some content. Think of it as a hyperlink...
<br> Here is a quick example:
<br> <a href="www.cnn.com"> What's Making News Now? </a>

<br><br> How do you incorporate <b>Images</b>?
<br> Most of the code we have learned so far incorporates both an opening and closing tag but it's important to highlight that images don't require this. The reason behind this is because images do no have any content. These types of tags are knonw as void tags. Sometimes, your image may not display properly on a site and therefore it is a good practice to give a user some text that alerts him/her of this case. Now, let's check out a picture of an oceanic paradise...

<p> Have you noticed all the whitespace that surrounds the picture and certain lines? This space can be created in one of two manners: by inserting breaks or by inserting paragraphs. There is also a differentiating set of terminology that is called inline vs. block. Inline elements are those that basically say the line ends here and block elements are those that make an invisible box around the elements themselves. </p>
